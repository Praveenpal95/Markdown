##  Overview
  
An assembly process necessarily entails the picking and transport of a multitude of devices with different dimensions and characteristics and their delivery in a number of different packages, from pre-diced wafers to gel packs.
  
##  What is an assembly line?
  
An assembly line is a process in manufacturing for the production of goods where smaller products are assembled at different steps in a sequence to produce the final product.

##  History of assembly lines
  
Before the Industrial Revolution, most manufactured products were made individually by hand. A single craftsman or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product. They would use their skills and tools, such as files and knives, to create the individual parts. They would then assemble them into the final product, making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together (craft production).
  
Division of labour was practised in China, where state-run monopolies mass-produced metal agricultural implements, china, armour, and weapons centuries before mass production appeared in Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. Adam Smith discussed the division of labour in the manufacture of pins at length in his book The Wealth of Nations (published in 1776).
  
##  Advantages of Assembly lines
  
  
- Semi-skilled labour is required.
- Much lower cost in mass production.
- Speed (Working Speed Increased)
- Comparatively, fewer working hours are required.
- Utmost Accuracy (less chance of mistake).
- Less training is required.
  
##  Disadvantages of Assembly lines
  
  
- large capital required.
- It took a long time to get the setup done.
- not suited to custom parts with frequent design changes.
- job loss.
- monotonous work (repeated work).
